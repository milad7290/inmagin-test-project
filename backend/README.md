# Getting Started with Inmagin backend project

This project is bootstrapped with Nest (https://github.com/nestjs)

## Make sure that you install and run MYSQL database

The project environment must add to project manually by adding .env file to root path (base on .env.example)

Before running the project you will need to create the database(schema) with your selected database name in .env file (which we recommend 'restaurant')
